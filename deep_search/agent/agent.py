Dear Sir/Ma’am,
I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Data Science Intern position at Data Science Research Services With a background in Finance and a minor in  Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and hands-on experience in machine learning, software development, and data analysis, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your research-driven projects.
Additionally, I am actively pursuing a Master's in Business Analytics, which is deepening my understanding of advanced statistical modeling, machine learning algorithms, and business intelligence tools. My involvement with the Illinois Business Consulting (IBC) group honed my problem-solving abilities, allowing me to work on client-focused projects that emphasize strategic data utilization. Furthermore, as the founder of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) RSO at UIUC, I lead initiatives exploring innovative applications of RAG in real-world problem-solving, fostering a collaborative learning environment for students interested in cutting-edge AI research.
My passion for practical machine learning applications is demonstrated through my development of a healthcare AI bot utilizing RAG, designed to enhance patient interactions through intelligent data retrieval. This project, alongside my work in client scooping software that automates data extraction and summarization, has strengthened my expertise in Python, data preprocessing, model training, and cloud integration while emphasizing clean, maintainable code and collaborative development.
The opportunity to work alongside researchers and fellow interns at Data Science Research Services contributing to the design, development, and deployment of impactful data solutions, greatly appeals to me. I am eager to bring my skills in machine learning, data science, and full-stack development to your team and support innovative, data-driven initiatives.
I welcome the chance to discuss how my background and skills can benefit your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Ashleyn Castelino
